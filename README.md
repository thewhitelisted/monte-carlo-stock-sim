# Monte Carlo Simulation in Rust

This is a cool monte carlo simulation that I made in rust

## Features

- **Concurrency**: Utilizes Rust's `std::thread` for parallel computation.
- **Random Number Generation**: Uses the `rand` crate for generating random numbers.
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling with Rust's `Result` and `Option` types.
- **Performance**: Leverages Rust's ownership and borrowing system for efficient memory management.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, ensure you have Rust installed. You can install Rust using `rustup`:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd monte
```

Build and run the project:

```sh
cargo build
cargo run
```
